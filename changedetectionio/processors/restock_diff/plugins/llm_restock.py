"""
LLM fallback plugin for price and restock info extraction.

When the built-in structured-metadata extraction (JSON-LD, microdata, OpenGraph)
fails to produce both a price and availability, this plugin is called as a last
resort.  It sends a trimmed, HTML-stripped version of the page to the configured
LLM and asks it to return a structured JSON answer.
