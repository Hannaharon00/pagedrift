Watch domain model for change detection monitoring.

ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Configuration Override Hierarchy
===================================================

This module implements Watch objects that inherit from dict (technical debt).
The dream architecture would use Pydantic for:

1. CHAIN RESOLUTION (Watch → Tag → Global Settings)
   - Current: Manual resolution scattered across codebase
   - Future: @computed_field properties with automatic resolution
   - Examples: resolved_fetch_backend, resolved_restock_settings, etc.

3. TYPE SAFETY & VALIDATION
   - Current: Dict access with no compile-time checks
   - Future: Type hints, IDE autocomplete, validation at boundaries

See class model docstring for detailed explanation and examples.
See: processors/restock_diff/processor.py:184-192 for manual resolution example
