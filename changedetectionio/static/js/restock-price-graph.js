// Restock price/stock timeline - a hand-rolled smoothed SVG line graph.
// Line segments are green where the item was in stock and red where it was out of stock.
//
// Two consumers:
//   * the restock diff page (#restock-graph), which fetches window.restock_data_url and also
//     builds the data table below it; and
//   * the watchlist inline roll-down, which calls window.renderRestockGraph(el, series, currency, i18n).
//
// Series shape (oldest -> newest): [{timestamp: <epoch sec>, price: <float|null>, in_stock: <bool|null>}]
