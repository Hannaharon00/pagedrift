Tests for the AI/LLM settings a group hands to its watches.

A group has exactly ONE AI control on its edit page — the ternary llm_backend_profile
("AI for watches in this group"):

  On                   the group's llm_intent / llm_change_summary apply to every watch in
                       it (unless the watch fills in its own), and AI is on for all of them
  Off                  AI off for every watch in the group; its prompts are never used
  Leave it to each     the group has no say; each watch's own AI settings apply
