Schema update migrations for the datastore.

This module contains all schema version upgrade methods (update_1 through update_N).
These are mixed into ChangeDetectionStore to keep the main store file focused.

IMPORTANT: Each update could be run even when they have a new install and the schema is correct.
Therefore - each `update_n` should be very careful about checking if it needs to actually run.
